Forms an imperative with the reduced or extra reduced stem. Forms nouns indicating place or time. Common suffix in place names, and less common suffix in personal names (e.g. 'to hunt' : 'hunting ground')", "1. verbal affix, locative series, infinitive-command form: 'there, yonder' : 'come or go to', 2. verbal affix, reflexive action series, infinitive-command form: 'lazy' : 'to feel lazy', 3. verbal affix, regular series, infinitive-command form: 'invite' : 'to invite', 4. alternant command suffix for verbs taking in the infinitive: or 'pass the salt', 5. nominal affix, locative: 'student' : 'school'", "(in the second passive) the prefix or is placed before the nominal form. The prefix is always used when the active has the suffix : in the passive, this suffix is replaced by ... The passive verbal substantives with the suffix do not always have a corresponding verb with the suffix . Their meaning can also be derived from another verbal form. For example, I have never come across a , which would mean 'to eat out of (something), as an active corresponding to : 1. 'that which can be eaten out of' (e.g. a large leaf); 2. 'from which one usually eats (a plate or a dish); 3. 'that which has been eaten into (by a disease)' (referring to marks left on the limbs by, for example, an eruptive skin disease... Such derived substantives represent a place where that which the verb represents usually takes place, or must take place... The suffix , just as the suffix , can, moreover, not only refer to a plural, but also to the repeated occurrence of the thing represented by the verb, or to its occurring on and off, for example, can also mean where it is customary for someone to walk... The suffix seldom denotes a direct object, but an example is 'messenger who is sent', from . (repetition of the stem-word) is, however, far more often found...where such a word has not been taken from or , representing , also means a plural, or repetition, or frequency ... (The second kind of nominal verb) has the suffix . a. When verbs of this kind are derived from substantives, the suffix indicates place and the subject is, therefore, represented by this verb as being a place where what the stem-word means can be seen (e.g. 'to sweat' = the place where the sweat is; 'to be bothered by flies' = something where flies are to be found), b. when this kind of nominal verb is derived from a verb, the subject is other than the stem-word, i.e. a person who is affected by what the stem-word represents (e.g. 'be bored' : 'boring', c. the suffix further strengthens what is represented by the stem-word and the derived form then means 'taking place continually', or 'occurring extensively' (e.g. 'be very laden' : 'heavy'; d. these verbs also mean 'an acquiring of', or 'a losing of', as a state (e.g. 'having deaths, of someone whose soldiers have been slain'; e. when they are derived from a qualificative verb, these verbs have the accent on the suffix and indicate that the quality exists to a greater degree (e.g. 'to be richer' : 'rich', 'to be a more skillful ' ... Words ending in a vowel can insert an before the suffix (e.g. , from )", "the suffix usually functions as the affix that focuses attention on the person or object or place toward which the action is directed or where the action is being carried out. Usually the actor focus counterpart of the suffix is : 'we bought from her (actor focus construction)', 'we bought from her (locative focus construction)", "1. suffix used to form passive nouns: that on which, in which, with which something is done (e.g. 'back (anat.)' : 'carriage', 'to hold, keep ahold of' : 'handle', 'stand, stand up' : 'place where one stands, position'); 2. suffix used to form deverbal adjectives or nouns with a passive sense, and carrying an implication of possibility or desirability; 3. suffix used to form adjectives with the meaning 'afflicted with, suffering from' (e.g. 'ant' : 'covered with ants', 'white spot on the cornea' : 'have a white spot on the cornea'; 4. substitute for the more commonly used , which expresses the comparative; here also belong indications of place and time in comparison with other place and time indicators; 5. suffix in connection with and 'how much', with the meaning 'how much not'; 6. verbal suffix with the meaning 'do something for the benefit of, do something with something, do something because of something, do something at a certain point in time'", "marker of nouns of location (e.g. 'what is drunk; way or manner of drinking' : 'to drink' : 'watering hole for animals in the jungle', 'path, road' : 'to walk' : 'path made by repeated walking over the same course", 'a suffix of general use, mostly locative', 'suffix of general use. First, it conveys a locative meaning; it is used to form names of places, or common nouns indicating certain places... Second, (like ) is a suffix which actually verbalizes a given word-base by making it pertain to the so-called passive voice..... The difference between the suffix and the suffix can be (in some way) clarified as follows: the suffix puts in evidence that the meaning of the word-base can be applied and, in fact, is applied to the direct object, while the suffix puts in evidence that the meaning of the word-base is only indirectly applicable to the grammatical object', "suffix of location (e.g. 'bathe' : 'bathing place, bath')", "local passive verb affix, future; noun forming affix. 1. forming nouns which refer to a place where something is found, done, held, located..., 2. forming nouns which refer to a person possessed of a certain power..., adjective forming suffix 1. forming adjectives which mean 'characterized by being [so-and-so]..., 2. added to nouns to form adjectives which mean 'having [so-and-so]", 'a voice-marking suffix, non-completive aspect, which subjectivalizes the locative case relation; a gerundivizing suffix occurring in combination with voice marking affixes... In appropriate contexts it also functions as a temporal or locative suffix', 'suffix with locative sense, where what the base-word says happens, is, or comes; afflicted with', "a third grammatical relation between the verb and the -phrase is indicated by the suffix : (cut -woman -man) 'The man is the one for whom the woman will cut it' or 'The woman will cut it for the man'. Here the action is performed on behalf of the one designated by the particle . The -phrase stands in an indirect relation to the verb. It may indirectly receive the action, be the location of the action, or be the associate or beneficiary of the action. The suffix thus marks referential voice", "suffix forming adjectives. The suffix is actually local, and in the second instance temporal, and it thus gives the place and time at which or in which the meaning of the stem word is realized... Examples of adjectives with the suffix are: 'loud, of sound' (from 'throat', 'evil-smelling' (from 'stench'), 'strong' (from 'bone'), 'be taboo' (from 'a taboo')...The collective function of which is found in some other languages is seen in 'to marry' (from 'spouse') ... In other cases the meaning of the stem word is not available in , and hence the precise meaning of the suffix cannot be determined"]
